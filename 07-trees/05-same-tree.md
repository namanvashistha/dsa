# Same Tree

## 📋 Problem Statement

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```

## 💡 Solution

```python
def isSameTree(p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:
    if not p and not q:
        return True
    
    if not p or not q:
        return False
    
    if p.val != q.val:
        return False
    
    return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Three checks** - Both null, one null, values equal
2. **Recurse on both children** - Both must match
3. **Simple recursion** - Clean and elegant
