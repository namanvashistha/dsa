# Max Area of Island

## 📋 Problem Statement

Given a binary matrix `grid` where `0` is water and `1` is land, return the maximum area of an island.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
               [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
               [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
               [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
               [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
               [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
               [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
               [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
```

## 💡 Solution

```python
def maxAreaOfIsland(grid: list[list[int]]) -> int:
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    max_area = 0
    
    def dfs(r, c):
        if (r < 0 or r >= rows or 
            c < 0 or c >= cols or 
            grid[r][c] != 1):
            return 0
        
        grid[r][c] = 0  # Mark visited
        
        return 1 + dfs(r+1, c) + dfs(r-1, c) + dfs(r, c+1) + dfs(r, c-1)
    
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == 1:
                max_area = max(max_area, dfs(r, c))
    
    return max_area
```
